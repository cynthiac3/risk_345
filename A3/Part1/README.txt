Using the Strategy design pattern, implement different kinds of players that make different decisions during the reinforcement, attack, and fortification phases. The kinds of players are: 
(1) human player that requires user interaction to make decisions
(2) an aggressive computer player that focuses on attack (reinforces its strongest country, then always attack with it until it cannot attack anymore, then fortifies in order to maximize aggregation of forces in one country) 
(3) a benevolent computer player that focuses on protecting its weak countries (reinforces its weakest countries, never attacks, then fortifies in order to move armies to weaker countries). 

You must deliver a driver that demonstrates that:
(1) different players can be assigned different strategies that lead to different behavior for the reinforcement, attack, and fortification phases using the strategy pattern; 
(2) the strategy adopted by a player can be changed dynamically during play, 
(3) the human player makes decisions according to user interaction, and computer players make decisions automatically, which are both implemented using the strategy pattern.
