Using the Observer design pattern, implement a view that displays some useful statistics about the game, the
minimum being a “players world domination view” that shows using some kind of graph or table depicting what
percentage of the world is currently being controlled by each player. This should dynamically be updated as the
map state changes and be visible at all times during game play. 

You must deliver a driver that demonstrates that:
(1) the game statistics view updates itself every time a country has been conquered by a player; 
(2) the game statistics updates itself when a player has been eliminated and removes this player from the view; 
(3) as soon as a player owns all the countries, the game statistics view updates itself and displays a celebratory message.
